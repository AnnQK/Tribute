                <li>Cersei was the only daughter and eldest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and his wife Joanna Lannister, who was also his cousin.</li>
                <li>Cersei was the elder twin of Jaime Lannister and the elder sister of Tyrion Lannister.</li>
                <li>Cersei's mother died when she was four years old, after giving birth to her younger brother Tyrion. Like her father, Cersei always blamed Tyrion for her mother's death.</li>
                <li>After the end of the civil war which ended the reign of House Targaryen, Cersei was married to King Robert Baratheon, a political marriage Robert agreed to in thanks for her father's last-minute alliance.</li>
                <li>She was only 19 when she married Robert and became Queen.</li>
                <li> She nevertheless bore Robert a son who died shortly after his birth. Cersei was devastated by the loss of her son and refused to have the body taken from her, forcing Robert to hold her while they took her son from her.[</li>
                <li>In time, Cersei's feelings for Robert turned to hatred and she returned to her brother as a result.</li>
                <li>Her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, were officially Robert's, but in reality were the products of her incestuous relationship with Jaime. </li>
